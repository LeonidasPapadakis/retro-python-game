This is a fun command-line choose-your-adventure game with an entrancing story, combat and riddles. 

I collaborated with a few classmates (Sean Wheeler, Sonny Normansell, Zainab Ashraf), to create this for a first-year Computational Thinking module at Cardiff University.

The player, Dante, searches for his lost brother Hans in a dark cave,
uncovering sinister secrets along the way. Lab reports reveal experiments within the cave
involving turning animals and people into monsters. Dante battles these mutants, pushing 
through the cave in search of his brother.
